# Ocean Code of Conduct

The Ocean community strongly values providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
environment for all, without prejudice. The Ocean team is committed to using
this code of conduct to foster these community values, both online and offline.

## Summary

Harassment in code and discussion or violation of physical boundaries is
completely unacceptable anywhere in Ocean's codebases, issue trackers, Slack,
meetups, and other events. This applies to both private and public settings.

We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone.
That is not welcome behavior.

## Our Values

- Whether you're a regular member or a newcomer, we value making this community
  a safe place for you.

  We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
  all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual
  orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age,
  religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.

- Respecting that people may differ in opinion from you leads to healthy
  discussion. This may help lead to fruitful understanding of why a certain
  approach was taken. Every design or implementation choice carries a
  trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.

## Conduct

- Do not **insult**, **demean** or **harass** _anyone_.

  We interpret the term "harassment" as including the definition in the [Citizen
  Code of Conduct]; if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included
  in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we don’t
  tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.

  Harassment in a private setting is just as unacceptable. No matter who you
  are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by
  a community member, please contact one of the core maintainers.

- Please avoid using overtly sexual aliases or other nicknames that might
  detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.

- Please be kind and courteous. There’s no need to be mean or rude.

- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.

- Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum.

  Rather than using language that criticizes the person, use language that
  focuses on the code or action itself.

  If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how
  it works.

- Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing
  behavior is not welcome.
