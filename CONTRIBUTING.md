# Contributing to Ocean

Thank you for taking the time to help improve Ocean! We are excited to have you
on board! ðŸ›³

There are several opportunities to contribute to Ocean at any depth. It doesn't
matter if you are just getting started or know what cursed code lies deep below,
we can use your help!

_All contributions_ are **valued** and _no contribution_ is **too small**.

The guide below will help you get your feet wet. Do not let this guide
intimidate you. Consider it a map to help you navigate Ocean, whether you're
dipping your toes or diving deep into the trenches.

## Conduct

The [Ocean Code of Conduct] describes the _minimum_ behavior expected from all
contributors.

## Contributing in Issues

Ocean uses [GitHub issues] to track the status of the project.

### Feature Requests

Please file a [feature request] if you have an idea for something you'd like to
see implemented in Ocean.

We have high expectations for what we want to see Ocean become. You are more
than welcome to set the bar even higher!

### Bug Reports

Please file a [bug report] if you encounter something odd or unexpected.

If you have the chance, before reporting a bug, please [search existing issues],
as it's possible that someone else has already reported your error. This doesn't
always work, and sometimes it's hard to know what to search for, so consider
this extra credit. We won't mind if you accidentally file a duplicate report.

If you're not sure if something is a bug or not, feel free to file a bug anyway.

## Contributing in Pull Requests

Pull Requests are the main way to directly change the code, documentation, and
dependencies of Ocean.

Even <sub>tiny</sub> pull requests (e.g., one character pull request fixing a
tpyo in API documentation) are greatly appreciated. Before making a large
change, it is usually a good idea to first open an issue describing the change
to solicit feedback and guidance. This will increase the likelihood of the PR
getting merged.
